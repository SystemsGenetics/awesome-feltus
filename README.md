# awesome-feltus

A guide to being awesome in the Feltus lab. Think of this page as a central hub that can help you get to wherever you need to go. Inspired by [cufctl/mlbd](https://github.com/CUFCTL/mlbd) and [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

## Introduction

Everyone in the Feltus lab is welcome to contribute to this guide, and to shape what it means to be awesome in the Feltus lab. I (Ben) am a software engineer, so I view awesome-ness through the lens of an engineer, but the Feltus lab is made up of engineers, scientists, and people in between, so I hope that in time this guide will reflect a holistic view of how to be awesome in the Feltus lab.

For now, this guide will show you around all of the fancy technology at your disposal, and give you tips on how to use them effectively.

## Getting Started

We use a lot of different technologies in the Feltus lab. The first step is to just know what they are.

First, the web applications you will use most often for your work:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/): That's where you are now! We put all of our code repositories here. Most of the lab's projects are [here](https://github.com/systemsgenetics). You can also make an account and store personal projects here.
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/): A website for creating LaTex documents for things like research papers. You'll want to learn how to write in LaTeX, and you'll want to do it through Overleaf.
- [Palmetto](https://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/): Clemson's supercomputer, the place where you will do most of your work. They also do tours! You can use Palmetto from your browser, go to [Palmetto OnDemand](https://openod02.palmetto.clemson.edu). More on that later.

Second, the software tools you will use, mostly within Palmetto. Feel free to peruse the links, but they are mostly for reference. You will learn these tools by using them:

- [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/): A package manager for Python and R packages. The command line tool is `conda`. You will want to learn how to use this tool.
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/): You probably use Windows or Mac. Well, Palmetto uses [Linux](https://linux.org/). And Bash is the language of Linux. You will want to get very good at Bash. Here is a [guide](https://devhints.io/bash).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): A tool for building and running containers. You might end up using it directly. Hopefully you won't have to. But it's good to know.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): A tool for maintaining code. Quit leaving your code all over the place and use version control! See GitHub above.
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/): A suite of tools for running code in an interactive "notebook". You will want to learn how to play with code this way.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/): A container orchestration system. You probably won't have to use this one directly, but Feltus is really excited about it, so you should probably know what it is.
- [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/): A programming language and a tool for running workflows. You'll understand why it's important later.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The programming language that everyone else uses for data science, so you probably should too. You could also use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) but it's not as cool. You should not use [Perl](https://www.perl.org/).
